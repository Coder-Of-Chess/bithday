        <h3>Omori</h3>
        <p>Omori stares at you, expressionless.<br>
           After a long pause, he holds up a sign that reads:<br>
           "<strong>Happy Birthday, Cel.</strong>"<br>
           No other words are spoken, but you feel a quiet sense of warmth in his silence.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="message">
        <h3>Sunny</h3>
        <p>"Hey, Cel... uh, Happy Birthday. Iâ€™m not great with words, but...<br>
           I hope this year brings you everything youâ€™re looking for."<br>
           He gives a small, shy smile before quickly glancing away.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="message">
        <h3>Kel</h3>
        <p>"<strong>Cel! Dude!! Happy Birthday!!!</strong> Letâ€™s make today the most awesome birthday ever! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰<br>
           I got you something super cool â€“ youâ€™re gonna love it! But first, how about we race to the park, huh?<br>
           Loser buys lunch!"

    <div class="message">
        <h3>Aubrey</h3>
        <p>"Happy Birthday, Cel! I made you a little something... I hope you like it."<br>
           Aubrey hands over a small, handmade gift, blushing slightly.<br>
           She tries to play it off as no big deal but clearly cares about it.<br>
           "Letâ€™s hang out soon, okay? We donâ€™t need any special reason to."
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="message">
        <h3>Hero</h3>
        <p>"Hey Cel! Happy Birthday! I hope todayâ€™s amazing for you. You deserve all the best things in life."<br>
           Hero flashes his charming, gentle smile and hands over a beautifully wrapped gift.<br>
           "Let me know if you need help with anything today â€“ Iâ€™ve got your back. And, oh, save room for dessert!<br>
           I baked a cake just for you."
        </p>

    <div class="message">
        <h3>Basil</h3>
        <p>"Happy Birthday, Cel! I hope today is as bright as you are. I, um, I pressed some flowers for you...<br>
           They reminded me of you."<br>
           Basil shyly hands over a delicate, handmade gift â€“ a small frame of pressed flowers, each chosen with care.<br>
           "Youâ€™re really important to us, you know? I hope you feel that today."
        </p>

        <h3>Mari</h3>
        <p>"<strong>Happy Birthday, Cel!</strong> I hope youâ€™re taking care of yourself and making the most of your special day.<br>
           You deserve all the happiness in the world, so make sure you smile today!"<br>
           Mariâ€™s soothing voice calms the room, and she offers a big hug.<br>
           "Oh, and if youâ€™re free later, Iâ€™ve got some fresh cookies and tea waiting!"
